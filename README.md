# RomanPort's Pebble Appstore
A replacement Pebble appstore I've been working on for the last few motnhs. It works in a web browser or the native Pebble app.

### Native 
This appstore supports all of the native features of the original appstore. Documentation for this will be released soon. Right now, downloading apps, setting the title bar, and more are supported by native. Check out /assets/v1/PblNative.js for more.

### Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the appstore running in a web browser.
